Drop support for EOL Pythons

Python 2.6 and 3.3 are end of life. They are no longer receiving bug
fixes, including for security issues. Python 2.6 went EOL on 2013-10-29
and on 2017-09-29. For additional details on support Python versions,
see:

Supported: https://devguide.python.org/#status-of-python-branches
EOL: https://devguide.python.org/devcycle/#end-of-life-branches

Removing support for EOL Pythons will reduce testing and maintenance
resources while allowing the library to move towards a modern Python 3
style.

Using pypinfo, we can show the PyPI download statistics, show very low
numbers for EOL Pythons.
