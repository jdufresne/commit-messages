Remove redundant type="text/javascript" from <script> elements

In HTML5, <script> elements default to MIME type text/javascript. The
HTML5 living standard and MDN recommend against including the attribute.

From https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/script#attr-type

> The HTML5 specification urges authors to omit the attribute rather
> than provide a redundant MIME type.

From https://html.spec.whatwg.org/#the-script-element

> Authors should omit the type attribute instead of redundantly setting
> it.
