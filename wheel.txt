Distribute package as a universal wheel

Wheels are the modern standard of Python distribution

Advantages of wheels:

- Faster installation
- Avoids arbitrary code execution for installation by avoiding setup.py
- Allows better caching for testing and continuous integration
- Creates .pyc files as part of installation to ensure they match the
  Python interpreter used
- More consistent installs across platforms

When you'd normally run `python3 setup.py sdist upload`, run instead
`python3 setup.py sdist bdist_wheel upload`.
