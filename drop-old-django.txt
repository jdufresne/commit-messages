Drop support for Django < 1.11 and remove workarounds

Per Django's recommendation, now that django-taggit supports 2.0, it should
drop support for Django < 1.11 to ease maintenance and compatibility across
Django versions. So long as no deprecation warnings are produced, django-taggit
should remain forward compatible with the next Django version.

For more details, see the Django docs:

https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.0/releases/2.0/#third-party-library-support-for-older-version-of-django

> Third-party library support for older version of Django
>
> Following the release of Django 2.0, we suggest that third-party app authors
> drop support for all versions of Django prior to 1.11. At that time, you
> should be able to run your packageâ€™s tests using python -Wd so that
> deprecation warnings do appear. After making the deprecation warning fixes,
> your app should be compatible with Django 2.0.
