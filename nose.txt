Remove dependency of unmaintained nose

The nose project has ceased development. The last commit is from Mar 3,
2016. From their docs page:

> Nose has been in maintenance mode for the past several years and will

> New projects should consider using Nose2, py.test, or just plain
> unittest/unittest2.

Simplify tests by using the stdlib unittest. One fewer dependency.
