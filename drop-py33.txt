Drop support for EOL Python 3.3

Python 3.3 is end of life. It is no longer receiving bug fixes, including for
security issues. Python 3.3 went EOL on 2017-09-29. For additional details on
support Python versions, see:

For details on the Python 3.3 release schedule, see:

Removing support for EOL Pythons will reduce testing and maintenance resources.
