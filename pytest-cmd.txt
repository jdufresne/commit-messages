Replace deprecated py.test command with pytest

The pytest project recommends using the command pytest as an entry
point, not py.test.

> Why can I use both pytest and py.test commands?
>
> pytest used to be part of the py package, which provided several
> developer utilities, all starting with py.<TAB>, thus providing nice
> TAB-completion. If you install pip install pycmd you get these tools
> from a separate package. Once pytest became a separate package, the
> py.test name was retained due to avoid a naming conflict with another
> tool. This conflict was eventually resolved, and the pytest command
> was therefore introduced. In future versions of pytest, we may
> deprecate and later remove the py.test command to avoid perpetuating
> the confusion.
